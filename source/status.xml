  Recent changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Linux on PowerPC</li>
  <li>Modified VM to throw an OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, or
  ArithmeticError instead of aborting the process when it runs out of
  heap space, detects stack overflow, or traps divide-by-zero,
  respectively</li>
  <li>Fixed many bugs concerning OpenJDK classpath compatibility.
  Many popular apps and libraries such as Eclipse, Tomcat, Geronimo,
  Batik, Lucene, Spring, Hibernate, and Jython have been verified to
  work with Avian/OpenJDK.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Releases</h3>
<p>
  The next planned release is 1.0.  No new features or architectural
  changes are planned except as necessary to fix bugs and to improve
  application compatibility for the OpenJDK port.  The main goal is to
  find and fix as many bugs as possible.
</p>

<h3>Post-1.0 Ideas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improve ahead-of-time compilation using <a
  href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a></li>
  <li>Add support for ahead-of-time escape analysis and bytecode
  annotation to indicate where objects may be safely allocated on the
  stack instead of the heap</li>
  <li>Rework memory allocation in garbage collector to improve
  performance in low memory situations
  (see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/avian/browse_thread/thread/5b3f13bf198334b3">here</a>
  for details)</li>
  <li>Experiment with optimizations and extensions to better support
  languages other than Java
    <ul>
      <li>First-class functions</li>
      <li>Lazy evaluation</li>
      <li><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">invokedynamic</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support additional architectures such as MIPS and 64-bit PowerPC</li>
</ul>
