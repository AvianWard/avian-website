  Recent changes:

  <li>Upgraded OpenJDK port to version 7, which is now the minimum
  supported version</li>

  compiled method, making debugger stack traces much more useful</li>
  <li>Added support for hardware floating point instructions on
  ARM</li>
  <li>Enabled use of LLVM Clang to build as an alternative to GCC</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Releases</h3>
